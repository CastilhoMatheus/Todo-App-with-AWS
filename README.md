# Todo List App
This project is a Todo List application built using React with TypeScript for the frontend, and several AWS services on the backend including AWS Lambda, RDS, Cognito, and API Gateway. The app allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, providing seamless functionality with authentication.

## Features
- Task Management: Users can create, edit, delete, and view tasks in a clean, responsive UI.
- User Authentication: Powered by AWS Cognito for secure sign-up and sign-in.
- Serverless Backend: The backend is built using AWS Lambda to handle API requests and interact with the database.
- Database: Uses Amazon RDS for persistent data storage of tasks.
- API Gateway: Manages API requests to the Lambda functions.

## Tech Stack
### Frontend:
- React (with TypeScript) for building the user interface.
- Styled Components / CSS Modules (replace with your actual styling solution if applicable) for UI styling.
### Backend:
- AWS Lambda for serverless functions.
- Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) for database storage.
- AWS Cognito for user authentication and management.
- AWS API Gateway for routing API requests.
